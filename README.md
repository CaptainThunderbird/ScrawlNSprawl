# 📌 Scrawl N Sprawl
**By Team Bloomscrollers** *Turning doomscrolling into bloomscrolling* 🌸

## 📖 Overview
**Scrawl N Sprawl** is a hyper-local kindness map that provides a digital scrapbook layer over the physical world. Instead of falling into the void of negative news, students can "scrawl" messages of support, gratitude, and joy, letting positivity "sprawl" across campus.

### 🌱 The Problem
Campus life can be isolating and high-pressure. Many students spend their breaks **doomscrolling**, which increases anxiety and disconnection. Currently, there is no lightweight, anonymous, location-based space for students to leave small acts of encouragement for others nearby.

### 🌸 The Solution
We created a digital third-place that acts as a community kindness layer. Students can:
* Leave kind messages on virtual sticky notes.
* Drop hand-drawn doodle stickers.
* Discover pockets of positivity near their current location.
* and most importantly, feel safe!

## 🗺 Core Features

* **📍 Location-Based Posts:** Click the map to drop a note, sticker, photo, or doodle with a unique "taped-on" look and random rotation for an authentic scrapbook feel.
* **🎨 Sticker Tray:** A selection of hand-drawn SVG stickers to express feelings without needing to type.
* **🔥 Kindness Heat Glow:** Areas with high note density emit a soft visual "warmth" on the map.
* **⏳ Ephemeral Content:** All posts (notes, stickers, photos, doodles) expire after 1–7 days to keep the map fresh and the community active.
* **⭐ Bookmarks:** Save favorite posts to a personal "Saved" tab that persists even after the post expires on the public map.
* **🛡 Safety First:** Built-in keyword filtering and a "positive-only" design (no likes/dislikes/comments) to prevent toxicity.

## 🎧 UX & Interaction Design
To win **Best UX**, we prioritized a tactile, physical aesthetic:
* **Paper Textures & Grain:** Removing the "flat" digital feel with subtle overlays.
* **Washi Tape Effects:** Using CSS semi-transparent masking for a hand-applied look.
* **Micro-interactions:** Spring-physics animations (notes "jiggle" on hover) and soft paper-crinkle sound effects.
